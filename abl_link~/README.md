# abl_link~
Windows 32 external for synchro inside puredata with ableton link protocol
source project : https://github.com/libpd/abl_link/tree/master/external
In order to compile for windows, i had to 
-install vc++2015 standalone compiler
-create a custom code:blocks project
because i couldn't use the make command and mingw environment
